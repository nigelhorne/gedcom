# Gedcom Utility

`Gedcom` is a powerful utility for managing and analyzing Gedcom genealogy files.
It offers a variety of tools for exploring family data,
identifying errors and presenting information in useful formats.

## Key Features

### Family Anniversaries

* Identify today's birthdays and death anniversaries from your family tree.

* Use the -l flag to include living relatives.

* The -d flag provides detailed biographies.

#### Autmate with Cron

Receive a daily e-mail:

    3 5 * * * gedcom -dl gedcom-file.ged

or

    22 5 * * * gedcom -dth 'Your Full Name' gedcom-file.ged

### Gedcom Validation

Identify and correct issues like:

* Missing or inconsistent data

* Duplicate entries

* Incorrect date formats

For example:

    gedcom -dAwWl gedcom-file.ged > /dev/null

To categorised errors:

    gedcom -dAwWl gedcom-file.ged > /dev/null 2> /tmp/errs
    sort -t: -k2 /tmp/errs

### Genealogy Calendar

Create month-to-page calendars for your family:

    for i in {1..12}; do
        gedcom -dwHm $i -y $(date +%Y) gedcom-file.ged > $i.html
    done

To filter calendars by surname:

    for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
    do
        gedcom -dwHlm $i -y $(date +%Y) -h 'John Smith' -s gedcom-file.ged > $i.html
    done

Create an ICS file to import to Google Calendar:

    gedcom -i /tmp/ics.ics gedcom-file.ged

### Google Maps Integration

Generate CSV files for mapping ancestor locations:

    gedcom -xsh Smith gedcom-file-ged > smith.csv

* Upload the CSV file to Google Drive
* Visit [Google Maps](https://google.com/maps),
on the 3 horizontal lines choose "your places" ("Vos adresses"), then "maps" ("Cartes")
* Click "create map", choose "import" and upload your file,
choose "Location" as the position column and "People" as the title column

You may see that several rows can't be seen in the map,
this is an opportunity to find locations in your map that are incorrect.

### Family History Book

Create a PDF genealogy book for special occasions:

    # Note that this will only print people related to your father, even if you give -a
    # yum install gd-devel ImageMagick-devel
    gedcom -B family-history.pdf -dh "Your Father's Full Name" gedcom-file.ged

For a surname-specific book:

    gedcom -GB smith.pdf -dsh 'John Smith' gedcom-file.ged

## Environment Variables

`Gedcom` honours the following environment variables for improved compatibility:

* BMAP_KEY - Bing (virtualearth.net) API Key
* GEONAMES_USER - geonames.org registered username
* GMAP_KEY - Google Places (maps.googleapis.com) API Key
* LANG - some handling of en_GB and en_US translating between then, fr_FR is a work in progress
* OPENADDR_HOME - directory of data from http -//results.openaddresses.io/
* REDIS_SERVER - ip:port pair of where to cache geo-coding data
* OPENAI_KEY - experimental: use the key from openai.com to enhance the text

## Runtime Options

`Gedcom` comes with various options that let you customize how your family tree website is generated.
Hereâ€™s what each option does:

### Command-Line Flags

| -y | year for -H calendar, or -T to give a list of places for a specific year |

## Running on Windows

* Firstly, if you're running Windows 10, install
[Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview)
or install Perl directly, either ActiveState or Strawberry should work fine.
I have also had success using Cygwin's Perl.

* Next follow the instructions at [local::lib](https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib#The-bootstrapping-technique).

* Load in all the CPAN modules that gedcom uses.
If you're not sure, run gedcom with no arguments and the program will install its core modules to get started.

## Bugs

There will be numerous strange handling of Gedcoms since it's not that tightly
observed by websites.
If you see lumpy English text in the output, or just plain mistakes,
please e-mail me or add a bug report to github.com/nigelhorne/gedcom.

I've tested against a number of Gedcoms including the Torture Tests at
https://www.tamurajones.net/DownloadTortureTests.xhtml and gedcoms
from gedcomlibrary.com.

With the -T option, countries and counties can be optimized out.
That will be fixed.

Different people use different ways to format and enter information,
ged2site goes out of its way to support all of these,
such as different location and date formats.
If your data shows issues with this aim, let me know.

The story telling format is hard coded, it would be useful if it were configurable.

## Pre-Requisites

Gedcom uses many CPAN modules which it will try to install if they are not
on your system.
If it doesn't have the necessary privilege to install the modules it will
fail on starting up with "permission denied" errors.
This is most likely because you're not running as root
(which is of course how it should be)
and you're not using [local::lib](https://metacpan.org/pod/local::lib),
or [Perlbrew](https://perlbrew.pl/).

Running the program for the first time with no
arguments should install them,
of course that will fail if you don't have the privilege,
in which case you'll need to add them by hand.
To install by hand you'll either have to use local::lib or perlbrew.
Of course you could also run gedcom as root,
but I strongly advise you don't do that.

You can also try
```cpan -i lazy && perl -Mlazy gedcom```
though I've not tested that.

To use the -B option on FreeBSD you'll need to
"sudo pkg install pkgconf gdlib ImageMagick7;
cd /usr/local/lib;
sudo ln -s libMagick++-7.so libMagickCore-7.Q16HDRI.so"

To use the -M option on FreeBSD you'll need to
"sudo pkg install apngasm"

## Acknowledgements

So many Perl CPAN modules that if I list them all I'll miss one, but special
mention goes to the [Gedcom](http://search.cpan.org/~pjcj/Gedcom/) module.
